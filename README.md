# SteamTableDemo
A visualizer for the HeuristicSearch crossword solver in my SchemeProlog Repo. The drawing is implemented using StdDraw.java and StdIn.java
I created this for a demonstration at the AI table at the American University STEAM fair for incoming students at the request of my AI professor. 

The Program takes 2 executable versions of the racket files included in the repository and desplays them in concurrent exectution. The threads run in lock step so essentially the program compares the number of interations that each of the puzzle-solving algos takes to find a solution to the crossword puzzle.
